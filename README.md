# Homework 2

## Learning Outcomes

- Debug existing code
- Write tests to catch bugs in unseen code
- Practice adhering to the level of visibility set in existing code
- Use Generic type annotations
- Write and analyze a stakeholder-value matrix

## Part 1 
- Provide some tests for the codebase to be used in HW3
   - Provide a short Pandas piece of code reading in the dataset
   - Different branches for Oakland vs Boston
- Some of the provided tests fail on provided code
- Use the debugger to figure out which functions have bugs
- Write more tests for that function

Tests:
- Passing the wrong data type (look at documentation to fix datatype)
  - strings vs lists (they look the same when compare str method)
- Tests where something was supposed to be unused from outside of the class, but it was used anyways, and that messed up the test

 

## Part 2 
- Submit their tests to our autograder, which runs studentsâ€™ tests on our buggy code
- The autograder checks if their tests catch our bugs
